    function set_opinion(graph, node_list, agent_list, random_influencer::Bool,
    replacement::Bool)

Choose an agent at random from the environment, and change its (or one of its randomly chosen graph neighbor's) opinion to match the neighbor (or agent).

# Arguments

- `graph`, `node_list`, `agent_list`: the current state of the simulation, as embodied in the graph and agent states.

- `random_influencer`: if `true`, the randomly-chosen agent will influence (change the opinion of) its randomly-chosen graph neighbor. Otherwise, the neighbor will change it.

- `replacement`: if `true`, puts back the last randomly selected node in the list of next nodes that can be selected. If `false`, takes out the last randomly selected node from the list of next nodes that can be selected.
